%Simple wing stress analysis, in a real scenario, you would need to 
% consider more complex wing geometries, varying load conditions, 
% detailed material properties, and potentially use finite element 
% methods for more accurate analysis.

% Wing Parameters
wing_span = 10; % in meters
wing_chord = 2; % in meters
wing_area = wing_span * wing_chord; % total area

% Material Properties
Youngs_modulus = 70e9; % in Pascals (for example, Aluminum)

% Load Parameters
uniform_load = 5000; % in Newtons per square meter

% Calculation of Bending Moment
% Assuming the maximum bending moment occurs at the root of the wing
max_bending_moment = (uniform_load * wing_area * wing_span) / 8;

% Wing Section Analysis - calculating stress at various points
num_points = 10; % number of points along the span to analyze
span_points = linspace(0, wing_span, num_points);

% Assuming a rectangular wing cross-section for simplicity
wing_height = 0.15; % in meters, thickness of the wing
wing_moment_of_inertia = (wing_chord * wing_height^3) / 12;

% Calculating bending stress
bending_stresses = max_bending_moment * span_points / wing_moment_of_inertia;

% Plotting the Bending Stress Distribution
plot(span_points, bending_stresses);
